## Setting Up the Application

Follow these steps to set up the application on your local machine.

### 1. Install Python 3.12+

If you don't already have Python 3.12 installed, download and install it from the official Python website:  
[Download Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)

After installing Python, verify it with the following command:

```bash
python --version

# Ensure that it outputs Python 3.12.x (or newer).
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

To avoid conflicts with other Python projects, create a virtual environment in your project directory:
```bash
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment:

# Windows (PowerShell):

.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```

# Install the required Python libraries using pip. Make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated. Run the following command to install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```
# Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

```

The server will start, and you can open the application by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000
 in your browser.
